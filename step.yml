  Autify Run Test
summary: |
  Run a test plan on Autify for Mobile.
description: |
  [Autify for Mobile](https://autify.com/mobile) is a test automation platform for your native app.
  This step allows you to upload your app built in the previous steps to Autify and start a pre-recorded test plan against the build.

  Optionally, this step can wait until the test plan finishes and fail if it doesn't pass.

  Also, you can specify already uploaded build and just start a test plan against it.

  If you want to upload your app to Autify, you need to build your app first by `Android Build`, `Xcode build for simulator`, etc.
  and refer the target build path (*.apk or *.app) at `Build path to test` input.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:
